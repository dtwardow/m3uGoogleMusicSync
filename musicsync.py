    musicsync.py

    Provides a utility class around the Google Music API that allows for easy synching of playlists.
    Currently it will look at all the files already in the playlist and:
     Upload any missing files (and add them to the playlist)
     Add any files that are already uploaded but not in the online playlist
     Optionally remove any files from the playlist that are not in the local copy (does not delete
     files!)
     Uploads are done one by one followed by a playlist update for each file (rather than as a
     batch)
    It does not remove duplicate entries from playlists or handle multiple entries.

    TODO: Add optional duplicate remover

    API used: https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API
    Thanks to: Kevion Kwok and Simon Weber

    Use at your own risk - especially for existing playlists

    Free to use, reuse, copy, clone, etc

    Usage:
     ms = MusicSync()
     # Will prompt for Email and Password - if 2-factor auth is on you'll need to generate a one-
       time password
     ms.sync_playlist("c:/path/to/playlist.m3u")

     ms.delete_song("song_id")
